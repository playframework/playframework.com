## XML External Entities

### CVE-ID

CVE-2014-3630

### Date

7 Oct 2014

*Update 19 Nov 2014*: Play 2.2.6 released with fix.

### Description

A vulnerability has been found in Play's Java XML processing.

An attacker may use XML external entities to read files from the file system, internal network, or DoS the application.

### Impact

Any application that uses the Java `play.libs.XML` API directly to parse XML from an untrusted source, or uses Plays `WS` client API to parse XML responses from an untrested server.

Specifically, this vulnerability does *not* affect Java actions that receive requests that contain XML bodies.  It also does not affect any Scala XML processing APIs offered in Play.

### Affected Versions

* Play 2.0 - 2.3.4

### Workarounds

Do not use the `play.libs.XML` API to parse XML, rather use a `DocumentBuilderFactory` configured as described by OWASP [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_\(XXE\)_Processing#JAXP_DOM_and_DocumentBuilderFactory).

Do not use the `play.libs.ws.WSResponse.asXml` method, rather use the `getBody` method, and parse it using a securely configured `DocumentBuilderFactory`.

### Fixes

Upgrade to Play 2.3.5 or Play 2.2.6.
