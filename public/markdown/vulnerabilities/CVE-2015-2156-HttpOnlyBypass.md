## Http only cookie bypass

### CVE ID

CVE-2015-2156

### Date

09 May 2015

### Description

A vulnerability has been found in Play's cookie handling code that could allow an attacker to bypass the `httpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies.

### Impact

Any Play apps that reflect cookie values back into the body of a response are vulnerable to this.  One example of when this might be a case is if using Play's CSRF support with `csrf.cookie.name` configured, such that Play stores the csrf token in a cookie rather than the default of storing it in the session.

### Affected Versions

* Play 2.0 - 2.3.8

### Workarounds

Upgrade to netty 3.9.8.  For example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.netty" % "netty" % "3.9.8.Final"
```

### Fixes

The issue has been fixed in Play 2.3.9.
