# Getting started with Play framework

## Learn whether Play Framework is right for your project

- [What is play?](documentation/2.8.x/Introduction)

## First time Play user?

Check out the [getting started guide](documentation/2.8.x/Home) to install system dependencies and run a minimal 
play application! This is the best place to start if you are new to Scala, Java or Play.

## Already know a bit about Play? 

[In the play-samples repository](https://github.com/playframework/play-samples) there are a variety of example 
projects in both Java and Scala for a particular use case. These include everything you need, including sbt, Play
Framework and 3rd part dependencies.

If you have all [system requirements](documentation/2.8.x/Home) installed, and you are ready to start your own project 
you can create a Play project from the command line. Go to you projects folder and run one of the following commands:

### Java seed template

```bash
sbt new playframework/play-java-seed.g8
```

## Scala seed template

```bash
sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
```

For more information on setting up the seed project, [Check out the documentation](documentation/2.8.x/Home).
