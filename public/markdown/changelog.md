## Play 2.3.2

*Released 21 July 2014*

* [2747](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/2747) Support for advanced TCP socket options such as keep alive.
* [2905](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/2905) Ensure assets changes don't trigger reload of Play

* [3173](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3173) Add support for JDK7 WatchService in dev mode

**Upgrade notes**

* On Windows and Linux on JDK7, Play now uses the JDK7 WatchService.  This has some small differences from the old mechanism - JNotify.  If the JNotify behaviour is preferred, this can be configured in `build.sbt` using:

    ```scala
    PlayKeys.playWatchService := play.sbtplugin.run.PlayWatchService.jnotify(Keys.sLog.value)
    ```

    Alternatively, you can also use a pure SBT implementation, using:

    ```scala
    PlayKeys.playWatchService := play.sbtplugin.run.PlayWatchService.sbt(pollInterval.value)
    ```

    Note that while the JDK7 WatchService works on other platforms, including OSX, its use is not recommended for Play's dev mode because on those platforms it simply polls the filesystem at a 2 second interval.

* [3064](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3064) Fixed HEAD support in CSRF filter

**Upgrade notes**

* The behaviour of the Assets reverse router has changed, if minified versions of assets exist, it now returns a URL for those instead.  To disable this behaviour, set `assets.checkForMinified=true` in `application.conf`.
* A change to the `SecurityHeadersFilter` constructor breaks binary compatibility.  This was done because the old constructor signature could not be used for its intended purpose without breaking it.

**Upgrade notes**

* The signature of the [CSRFFilter](/documentation/2.2.1/api/scala/index.html#play.filters.csrf.CSRFFilter) constructor has changed.  Any code that used this previously should still be source compatible, but may need to be recompiled.
* CommonJS module support used to be provided by default when using the JavaScript compiler. It no longer is as there were problems with its support on Windows. CommonJS module support can be re-enabled by using a `commonJs` option for the JavaScript compiler.
