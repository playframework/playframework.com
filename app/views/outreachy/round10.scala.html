            <h2>Outreachy - Round 10</h2>

            <p>
                Typesafe and Play Framework are proud to be participating in
                <a href="//gnome.org/outreachy/">Outreachy</a>, a program to help groups that are underrepresented
                in free and open source software get involved.  For detailed information about Outreachy, including how
                to apply, see the <a href="//wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy">main program page</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the landing page for Outreachy Play Framework projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Applications for Round 10 Play Framework projects close on the <b>7th of April</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting started</h2>

            <p>
                The best way to get started is to read Play's <a href="@routes.Application.getInvolved()">Get Involved</a>
                page.  From there you can find information about the project issue tracker and mailing lists, links to
                instructions for building Play from source.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best place to talk about Play development is on the
                <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework-dev">Play development mailing list</a>.
                Discussion about Outreachy Play projects itself can be had in the
                <a href="//gitter.im/playframework/outreachy">Play Outreachy Gitter channel</a>, where Play
                Outreachy mentors can be found (though note that the Play team is very geographically distributed,
                including developers in Australia, New Zealand and Europe, so don't expect to get immediate responses
                from any particular person.
            </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>
                Typesafe is sponsoring one intern for Play Framework in Outreachy in Round 10.
            </p>

            <h3>Dream REST development in Play</h3>

            <p>
                Mentor: <a href="//github.com/jroper">James Roper</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                While Play makes it very simple to write REST APIs, there are a number of features and improvements that
                can be added to Play so that out of the box, REST API development in Play Framework is a dream.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project consists of a number of small development tasks, as well as some not so small development
                tasks, plus tutorial style documentation to make the developer experience for writing REST APIs in Play
                even smoother than it already is.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project will start with the small tasks, allowing the intern to get comfortable working in the
                Play codebase, and work up to bigger tasks.  The exact scope depends on how much the intern is able to
                get done and what they choose to prioritise, but even with the smaller tasks, the intern will have made
                a valuable contribution to Play Framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tasks include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Support for HATEOAS links in Play's JSON API</li>
                <li>Support for <a href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570">RFC 6570</a> URI templates in Play's JSON API</li>
                <li>RFC 6570 integration in Play's reverse router</li>
                <li>Support for generating/parsing <a href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">RFC 5988</a> link headers</li>
                <li>Tutorial style documentation on writing a REST API using Play with Java or Scala</li>
                <li>CRUD routing capabilities to minimise necessary REST API boilerplate</li>
                <li>Opinionated action builders that assume JSON bodies and have built in support for paging</li>
                <li>Plus a number of refactoring/code improvement tasks to facilitate the above tasks along the way</li>
            </ul>
