                <p>
                    Bug reports help Play improve, so please report any issues you have! Play uses <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/issues">GitHub to track issues</a>. When you report bugs, make sure you include lots of detail, including reproducible tests, example code or anything else you think might help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if you're not ready to fix issues yourself just yet, you can help out by verifying issues that have been reported by others. Look for issues tagged with the <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/issues?labels=needs-verification"><span class="issueLabel">needs-verification</span> label</a>. You can assist by looking at these issues and doing some checking to confirm whether they're bugs or not. You could provide reproducible tests or a sample project, or even just ask the original reporter for more information.

                    Play's code and documentation is hosted on <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework">Github</a>. It's easy to <a href="@controllers.documentation.ReverseRouter.latest(None, "BuildingFromSource")">get the code and build Play from source</a>. Play development is discussed on the <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework-dev"><span class="mailingList">play-framework-dev</span> mailing list</a>. You can ask on the list if you have any questions, or you can also chat to Play contributors through the <a href="//gitter.im/playframework/contributors">gitter.im</a> channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're welcome to work on any feature you like&mdash;Play is open source after all!&mdash;but if you'd like some good ideas, look for issues tagged with the <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/issues?labels=community"><span class="issueLabel">community label</a>. These issues are ready and waiting for volunteers to pick them up.

                <p>
                    You can add new features to Play applications by creating a module. Writing new modules is often easier than patching Play's core code. You can learn about creating modules for <a href="@controllers.documentation.ReverseRouter.latest(None, "ScalaPlayModules")">Scala</a> and <a href="@controllers.documentation.ReverseRouter.latest(None, "JavaPlayModules")">Java</a>.
