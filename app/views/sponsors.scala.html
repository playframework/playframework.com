            <h1>Why sponsor Play?</h1>
            <p>
                At the end of 2021 <a href="//www.lightbend.com/">Lightbend</a>, the company that sponsored and lead the development of the Play Framework for almost a decade, <a href="//discuss.lightbend.com/t/on-the-future-of-play-framework/8920">handed over the project to the community</a>.
                Since then the Play Framework uses <a href="//opencollective.com/playframework">Open Collective</a> to gather money to pay contributors and to cover other project expenses in <a href="//opencollective.com/how-it-works">the most transparent way possible</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your donation will help the project stay live and grow successfully.
                If you are interested in helping us maintain a vibrant community of contributors to improve and support the Play Framework, please go to <a href="//opencollective.com/playframework">our Open Collective page</a> to become a backer or a premium sponsor.
            </p>
            <div class="donate-button">
                <a href="//opencollective.com/playframework">Donate to our Collective</a>
            </div>
            <p>Of course, we also encourage and highly appreciate <a href="@routes.Application.getInvolved">other ways to contribute</a> to the project and its community as well.</p>

                <h2>Who is responsible?</h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of 2021, a group of people which have been heavily involved with Play's development in the past, formed a steering committee, which will lead the project and will take responsibility for the future development of the framework.
                    All of its members contributed a substantial amount of code to Play or its sub projects and some are even former employees of Lightbend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These members are:
                    <ul>

                <h2>What will the project do with the money?</h2>
                <p>
                    Open Collective is a public and fully transparent plattform, so you have <a href="//opencollective.com/playframework/transactions">full insight into the projects financials</a>.
                    Anyone can <a href="//opencollective.com/playframework/expenses/new">file an expense</a>, which needs to be approved by Play's Open Collective admins to get it reimbursed.
                </p>
                <p>The money will be used to cover following project costs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payouts to core contributors working on Play</li>
                    <li>Website Hosting</li>
                    <li>Developer tooling and licenses</li>
                    <li>Legal protection</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If enough money is available we will use it to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement a bug bounty system, see <a href="//github.com/playframework/play-meta/issues/190">this discussion</a></li>
                    <li>Pay expenses for developer gatherings: travel & food expenses for conferences and team meetings</li>
                    <li>Pay for project goodies</li>
                    <li>Pay Meetup fees</li>

                <h2>What are the next steps?<br/></h2>
                <p>
                    <i>(December 2021)</i><br/>
                    Please have a look at our <a href="//github.com/orgs/playframework/projects/1">GitHub project board</a> to see what is happening and what needs to be worked on to transform Play to a community-led organization.
                    We also got asked about a roadmap and priorities regarding Play's development goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Security fixes</b><br/>
                        Until now, when a security problem was reported, the Play team tried to fix it as soon as possible and usually released a new minor Play version containing a fix shortly afterwards. We plan to continue with this practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Support of the latest version of JVM</b><br/>
                        Work to support for Java 17 LTS started in spring this year already, resulting in a dirty, but working, <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/10819">pull request</a> which just needs some clean up to finally make it into the main branch. That means upcoming Play 2.9 will definitely support Java 17 LTS. Besides that, we plan to continue supporting Java 8 for at least Play 2.9 (actually there is absolutely no reason to drop it anytime soon).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Support of the latest versions of sbt</b><br/>
                        That is our priority as well. In spring this year we made Play work with sbt 1.4+ (See <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/10648">#10648</a>, <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/10711">#10711</a> and <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/10655">#10655</a>. Adjustment in Play's code were needed because sbt 1.4 shipped with some internal changes (by adopting an internal "virtual filesystem") that made it incompatible with Play.<br/>
                        Long story short: We will definitely support new sbt versions soon after they are released.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Support of the latest versions of Scala</b><br/>
                        We plan to support Scala 3 as well. There is quite an interest in the community and also people willing to work on that. If everything goes well, we might see support for Scala 3 in Play 2.9 already.
                        We <a href="//github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/10956">dropped support</a> for Scala 2.12 and sbt <=1.3 in the main branch already, to make it easier to cross build Play against Scala 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>New releases for Play 2.7 or older</b><br/>
                        We recognized some people wish that old Play versions should be maintainend longer, at least they should receive security and critical bug fixes. However that is a matter of who can invest time to maintain these old versions and therefore more or less depends on funding of the project. So if you want to see releases of older Play versions, please support the project financially.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Maintaining a stable API</b><br/>
                        Right now, there is no plan to introduce any groundbreaking API changes. The plan for now is to make sure that Play stays maintained to get minor releases out and to finally cut Play 2.9 in the upcoming months. So, there is no plan to drive Play into a new direction. Of course there will very likely be new features, but after talking to companies and users that actively use Play in production, the goal right now is more that there are contributors that keep Play maintained in regards of supporting newest sbt/JVM/Scala versions, security fixes and new minor releases with fixes and major releases with new features wished by the community.
                        As we did with the last major releases, we will publish migration guides.
