            <h2>Certified Reactive Application Programmer</h2>

            <p>
                In today's technology landscape, where companies of every industry are finding that software must be one
                of their core competencies, it's crucial to differentiate good developers from the rest.  With changing
                paradigms, new technologies, and an ever evolving landscape of best practices, it can be very hard for
                organizations to know how to hire good developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                To address these difficulties, the Play team is offering a new certification program, with the first
                certification being the <em>Certified Reactive Application Programmer</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Certified Reactive Application Programmer combines the technical rigor of a rock star developer with
                the leading edge architectural and design practices outlined in
                <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org">The Reactive Manifesto</a>.  They have been trained and
                tested not only to be competent at building reactive applications, but to embody the essence of
                reactive in themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                Training for the Certified Reactive Application Programmer is divided into four sections, matching the
                four tenets of the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org">The Reactive Manifesto</a>:
            </p>

            <h3>Responsive</h3>

            <p>
                The developer responds in a timely manner if at all possible. Responsiveness is the cornerstone of
                developer productivity and value, but more than that, responsiveness means that problems may be detected
                quickly and the developer fired effectively. Responsive developers focus on providing rapid and
                consistent response times to emails and other communication, establishing reliable upper bounds so they
                deliver a consistent quality of service. This consistent behaviour in turn simplifies performance
                reviews, builds manager confidence, and encourages further work delegation.
            </p>

            <h3>Resilient</h3>

            <p>
                The developer stays responsive in the face of sickness. This applies not only to highly-available
                site reliability engineers — any developer that is not resilient will be unresponsive after a sickness.
                Resilience is achieved by medication, working from home, delegation, and hardening up. Sickness is
                contained within each team, isolating teams from each other and thereby ensuring that parts of the
                company can get sick and recover without compromising the company as a whole. Recovery of each team is
                delegated to an external doctor and high-availability is ensured by medication where necessary. The
                client of a team is not burdened with handling its sickness.
            </p>

            <h3>Elastic</h3>

            <p>
                The developer stays responsive under varying workload. Certified Reactive Application Programmers can
                react to changes in the work they receive by increasing or decreasing the number of hours they spend at
                work. This implies people that have no life work balance or regular commitments, resulting in the
                ability to change working hours and substitute sleep with work. Certified Reactive Application
                Programmers support predictive, as well as reactive, sleep patterns by providing relevant live
                performance measures. They achieve elasticity in a cost-effective way on commodity beds and linen.
            </p>

            <h3>Message Driven</h3>

            <p>
                Certified Reactive Application Programmers rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary
                between teams that ensures loose coupling, isolation, location transparency, and provides the means
                to delegate employee termination as messages. Employing explicit message-passing enables load management,
                elasticity, and flow control by shaping and monitoring the performance of the developers and applying
                discipline when necessary. Location transparent messaging as a means of communication makes it possible
                for management to fire developers with the same constructs and semantics across business units or in a
                single office. Non-blocking communication allows developers to only consume resources while awake,
                leading to less office overhead.
            </p>
